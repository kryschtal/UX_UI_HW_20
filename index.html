  <br>
  <p>Adult men and women want to improve their eating habits, but find it difficult to track
    what they are eating throughout the day. They want to be able to see how balanced
    their diet is.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Morsel is a simple interface designed for the iOS of a smartphone and smartwatch to
    track the intake of the major food groups. It helps users to visualize how balanced their diet
    Is on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. `</p>
    <br>
    <p>Over the course of 2 weeks and along with one team member we both conducted research, 
    created a prototype, conducted usability test and iterated based on those findings.</p>  
    <br>
    <p>We used Google Suite, Adobe XD, and InVision during this project.</p>

                Our competitor analysis showed us early on
                that trackers were typically too complicated
                requiring more than 15 minutes on average
                to put in one meal. Some also lacked historical
                data.
                
                We conducted 5 semi-structured 30 minute
                interviews and received 14 responses to a survey
                sent out.

              <p>Majority of our users considered themselves generally healthy but still wanted to improve
their diet.

Having a balanced diet was what was most important to them, with the goal of living a long
and active life. 

29% of our survey respondents prefer using a tracking method to keep them accountable.

                      habits to notice trends and missing gaps.

  <br>
  <p>There are many things we found successful in this project. We had created a simplified interface for users to
    track their food focusing on their food group intake rather than calories to show how balanced the users diet 
    was.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The major steps going forward would be to flush out was is a proper serving size and to teach the users how
      to incorporate that into their daily tracking. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We would also want to include badge functionality along with create proper push notifications that won’t 
      deter the users. </p>  
    <br>
    <p>Finally it would be important to allow the users more control over their icons they are using and their order. 
      If a vegetarian or vegan are using this tool it is unlikely they would want a big icon of a steak to help represent
      protein.</p>
